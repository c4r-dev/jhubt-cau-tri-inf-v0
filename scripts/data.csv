Does regular physical exercise causally improve academic performance in students?,Observational - Human,"2,500 high school students across 15 schools","Surveyed sports team participation, GPA, and standardized test scores, controlling for family income, parental education, and study time",Students participating in organized sports had significantly higher GPAs (3.4 vs 2.8) and test scores compared to non-athletes,•Reverse causation possible (better students join sports teams),Experimental - Animal Model,120 laboratory mice,"Randomly assigned to high exercise (running wheels 6hrs daily) vs sedentary conditions for 8 weeks, then cognitive testing","Exercise mice showed better spatial memory and learning, plus increased BDNF in hippocampus",•Mouse cognition may not translate to human academic performance,"•Access to exercise opportunities (varies by socioeconomic status, geography, school resources)"
,,,,,"•Unmeasured confounders (self-discipline, family values)",,,,,•Artificial lab environment lacks real-world complexity,•Motivation and self-discipline (could drive both exercise and academic success)
,,,,,•Selection bias (sports team members differ systematically),,,,,•Simple cognitive tasks ≠ multifaceted academic performance,•Family values and support systems
,,,,,•Access barriers vary by socioeconomic status,,,,,•Equal access design misses real-world access barriers,•Time management and organizational skills
